This is a violin plot that I recently created by aggregating the precipitation data from Lake Michigan and Lake Huron to create this visualizaiton. Through this graph, I wanted to create a comparison between the both sets of mean precipitation data since Lake Michigan and Lake Huron are close to each other and often considered one region.
