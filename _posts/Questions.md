title: Questions

Here are a few data science questions relating to my project that I plan to answer through my work with the data I found. 

    - How has the lake water levels changed over time and have increases or decreases in levels have something to do with climate change? (water temperature, air temperature)
       - How have the levels changed over time (scatter plot, by year)
       - Does the temperature of the earth or the amount that the heat increases every year affect the water levels?
    - How has evaporation and cloud cover affected the water levels? 
       - Was there less evaporation during a period of time with lower water levels?
    - Has air temperature affected the quantity of precipitation? 
       - Has there been more or less snow over time?
    - How does the amount of snow and ice affect the water level?
