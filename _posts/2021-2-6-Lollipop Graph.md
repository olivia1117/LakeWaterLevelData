Hello! I'm back with a new update on my progress. Lately, I've created a lollipop graph to show the minimum and maximum air temperatures from 1948 to 2014. It was very interesting to learn how to create this type of graph as experiment with some colors as well. The main purpose of making this graph was to help show the average temperature variations and roughly what the air temperature has been like overall for the selected years. Clearly, the air temperature is the highest in summer months such as June, July, and August and then declines.
