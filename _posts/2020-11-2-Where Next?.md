So far I've made lots of different visualizations and I've recently been working on learning more about linear regression both through my stats class as well as through coding. I've also learned more about pie charts and stacked bar graphs as well. Since I have gotten better at creating these graphs, I want to start using them to compare and contrast different aspects about Lake Michigan. For my next visualizations, I think I will take a closer look at air temperature over the lake and try to answer the question if the air temperature changes in the same pattern that the water level does.
