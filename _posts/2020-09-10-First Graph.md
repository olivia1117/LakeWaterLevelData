I just finished my first "official" graph for my website. I created a graph showing the mean water level for the Michigan-Huron region every year from around 1920. It was a really interesting process to find the right data to use for this graph and to determine a good way to display it. I eventually chose to use a histogram and to measure the water in feet. I originally hypothesized based on my experiences with going to Lake Michigan every summer, that the graph will show a rise in water levels around the year 1980 and around these past years from 2019-2020. I've seen the lakefront rising over the years I've been there myself and have heard from other people that the water was also high during the 1980s as well. However, I further hypothesized that the rise in water levels could be due to climate change. But now when I see the graph, I am not so sure because the graph shows instances of earlier times when the water was much higher as well such as the 1920s and 1950s. Overall, this is a great place to start and to ask more questions. Perhaps the water levels are influenced more by the air temperature during those years or how much precipitation falls over that region annually.
