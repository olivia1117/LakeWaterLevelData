This is my first blog post since starting to create this website. I've been making a lot of progress in terms of learning how to make changes in GitHub to my site and being able to look things up when I get an idea for something new to add or change on my site. For example, I recently learned how to swap out the template photos for some of my own of Lake Michigan. I also have been experimenting with the colors of my fonts and adding new tabs such as the bibliography tab. I'm very excited to continue learning how to improve these web design skills as well as adding more data to my site! Graphs will be coming soon hopefully!
