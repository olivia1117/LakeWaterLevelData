Here is my next graph. After creating a visualization for the mean water level in the Lake Michigan region, I was curious to see if precipitation, specifically snow, would have any affect on the water level in Lake Michigan. This is why I chose to only use the months of January, February, November, and December. Snow occurs the most during these months and also when parts of the lake experience freezing.
