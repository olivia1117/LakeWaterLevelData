Here is my next graph. After creating a visualization for the mean water level in the Lake Michigan region, I was curious to see if precipitation, specifically snow, would have any affect on the water level in Lake Michigan. This is why I chose to only use the months of January, February, November, and December. From my own experiences of being in this region during these months, I know that snow occurs the most during this time. It is also a time when Lake Michigan experiences some large sheets of ice on top of the water as well. When I compared this visualization to my previous Mean Water Level Graph, I noticed that the amounts of precipitation were the greatest during the month of November between about 1985 to 1992.
