Here is my next graph. After creating a visualization for the mean water level in the Lake Michigan region, I was curious to see if precipitation, specifically snow, would have any affect on the water level in Lake Michigan. This is why I chose to only use the months of January, February, November, and December. From my own experiences of being in this region during these months, I know that snow occurs the most during this time. It is also a time when Lake Michigan experiences some large sheets of ice on top of the water as well. When I compared this visualization to my previous Mean Water Level graph, I noticed that the amounts of precipitation were the greatest during the month of November between about 1985 to 1992. This corresponds roughly to the same years when the water level was extremely high on my previous graph. However, this pattern doesn't fit for the other years. For example, starting around the year 2000, the Mean Water Level graph shows that the water level was significantly lower unlike the precipitation data for November and January which were at relatively high levels. Because of these trends in the data, I am now not quite sure that high precipitaiton or more specifically, snow in this case, shows a link toward higher water levels in Lake Michigan.
